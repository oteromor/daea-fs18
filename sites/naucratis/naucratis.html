		 <p>Naucratis is an archaeological site discovered in 1884 by Sir William Flinders Petrie, located on the western branch of the Nile delta. The only information on the site at that time were the writings of Herodotus, a Greek historian, and Petrie references his writing often in his records of his excavations. The site has suffered much destruction through the ages, and presently is mostly underwater, but has undergone several excavations allowing archaeologists to gather the information they have on the site today. (Moller) Petrie placed Naucratis’ establishment around 670 B.C., and it was the only trading port in Egypt where Greeks were allowed (Winslow, 2). Therefore, much of the archaeological evidence at the site points at the presence of the Greeks at Naucratis. Most notable is the pottery; many styles of Greek pottery have been found at Naucratis. Some have even suggested that one style, Chian pottery, was even produced at Naucratis, due to a combination of Greek and Egyptian techniques (Moller, 136). Another indicator of Greek presence at Naucratis were several temenos, or sacred enclosures, dedicated to Greek deities (Muhs, 99). Other notable features include the Great Mound, the Great Temenos, a cemetery, and the Scarab Factory.</p>

     <h3>Location</h3>
  <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->



<p>Naucratis is located in the Nile delta, off the western (Canobic) branch of the Nile near the modern town of Kom Ge’if.  In ancient times the Nile was supposed to be much closer to the site, but today they are not connected (Villing). There is debate over whether the original location of Naucratis was on the east or west bank of the Nile. Petrie believed it to be on the west bank, basing his claims on the writings of Herodotus, but most other scholars believe it to have been on the east bank. During Petrie’s first excavation a part of the site was underneath a local cemetery, which before being built about 30 years before Petrie got there was a chapel, which did help with some of the preservation of the site by keeping locals away. When Petrie tried to work around the cemetery, he was asked by the owners of the cemetery to help relocate it (Muhs, 102). Today much of the site is underwater, making further excavations difficult, and there is nothing there to attract tourists, so it is relatively abandoned. Furthermore, it is not connected by any main roads, making it difficult to get to (Moller, 89). </p>
